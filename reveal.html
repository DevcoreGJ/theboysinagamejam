  <h1>The theme</h1>
  
  <p>So here goes... The theme is: hierarchy of needs vs two factor theory, Because I have been obsessing over these for a while.<br>
  <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html#:~:text=From%20the%20bottom%20of%20the,attend%20to%20needs%20higher%20up.">Hierarchy of needs</a><br><br>
  <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/herzbergs-two-factor-theory.html">Two factor theory</a><br><br>
  </p>	
  <p>The cool idea behind this is that without even realising it, these two concepts drive our lives. <br> In the spirit of 
  innovation metaverses and all things gammes, it would be interesting to see a world building and/or character development/mechanics built around these concepts. <br>-resize
  admmittedly they are mainly based around work. but they can be applied to any aspect of the humman experience.<br><br>
	
	Do needs beget motivations or do motivations beget needs?</p>
